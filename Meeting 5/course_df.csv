1487	CJS 278  Introduction to Law Enforcement 3.0 Credits	This course examines the implications of maintaining an armed police force in a democratic society whose mandate requires it to enforce laws under the tacit threat of coercion. The course explores different styles of policing that are commonly found in urban, rural, and suburban locations; and it examines the rise and consequences of historic crime control paradigms, such as the War on Drugs, and the War on Terrorism. It offers an overview of Supreme Court decisions that have most affected police functions and authority. And it will highlight the police use of technology for the purposes of coercion, surveillance, and communication.

1488	CJS 280  Communities and Crime 3.0 Credits	This course introduces students to the ecological study of crime. Crime varies in time, space, and populations as it reflects neighborhood structures and the routine social interactions that occur in daily life.  Concentrations of crime can be found among locations, with antisocial activities like assaults and theft occurring at higher rates because of the demographic make-up of people (e.g., adolescents) or conflicts (e.g., competing gangs), for reasons examined by ecological criminology.  We examine variations in socio-demographic structures (age, education ratios, and the concentration of poverty) and the physical environment (housing segregation, density of bars, street lighting) predicts variations between neighborhoods in the level of crime and disorder.

1492	CJS 300  Research Methods and Analytics II 3.0 Credits	This course builds on (and reviews) the fundamentals of research design introduced in Methods and Analysis I with the specific aim of teaching students how to construct, and analyze data generated from, surveys. Students will learn the “mechanics” of survey design, such as where to place demographic questions, as well as how to identify and include validated scales on the instrument, and how to avoid misleading or debilitative items (e.g., “double-barreled” questions, biased/leading questions, non-mutually exclusive or exhaustive response categories. Students will also learn the process (and importance) of pre-testing the survey prior to implementing it; and they will be trained to analyze survey results using SPSS and other software packages as needed.

1493	CJS 301  Methods and Analytics III 4.0 Credits	The course focuses on the development of a community needs assessment as a platform for giving students the opportunity to work as part of a research team in the field, creating a data collection instrument, collecting and analyzing data, and reporting the findings. The course integrates the community needs assessment methodology with the urban disorder literature to educate students in the modes of observation required to reliably measure crime, disorder, surveillance gaps, and other sources of community risk. Students will map community demographic features, develop an assessment tool, make field observations, and analyze the findings as part of their culminating experience.

1494	CJS 302  Advanced Criminological Theorizing 3.0 Credits	This course offers a detailed examination of several major theories of crime. Whereas CJS200/CJ204-Criminology represents a survey of many criminological theories, this advanced course focuses on three major perspectives in criminology: Life-course, genetics/bio-social, social disorganization (and specifically, subculture of violence) theories. The course also helps students understand how different criminological theories might integrate with each other to offer broad perspectives the causes of crime.

1495	CJS 320  Comparative Justice Systems 3.0 Credits	This course offers students a transnational perspective on crime and justice institutions. As the world increasingly globalizes, it becomes increasingly important to understand how countries outside the United States undertake the processes of detecting crime, labeling people “criminal,” and adjudicating criminal offenders. Is there a common threshold in other countries for determining guilt? Is there a universal standard that governs the presumption or guilt or innocence at the onset of the criminal justice process? How many other countries still use the death penalty? These are questions the course will address in addition to others related to policing, courts, and corrections.

1496	CJS 330  Crime Mapping I Using Geographic Information Systems 4.0 Credits	This course introduces students to the fundamentals of crime mapping through both lecture and the use of geospatial software. The course opens with a history of crime mapping, then moves to an examination of several place-based theories of criminology that help explain why crime events often cluster in time and space. The course then uses scenario-based exercises to teach students to work with and manage geospatial data, conduct select spatial analyses, interpret the results of such analyses within the contexts of different criminological theories, and create maps that illustrate spatial patterns and relationships across different units of geography.

1504	CJS 372  Death Penalty - An American Dilemma 3.0 Credits	Capital punishment is one of the most complex issues in Criminal Justice and one of the most controversial facing America. Everyone has an opinion about the death penalty but rarely is it grounded in hard evidence. This course will examine the history of the use of capital punishment in America by reviewing the relevant case law in this area and will explore in-depth the issues which rise from the use of the Death Penalty in this country. Is it ethical? Is it fairly administered? Is it effective? Should it be reformed? Can it be reformed?.

Those who survived, and millions more of their descendants, were bought and sold as commodities and forced to labor under conditions of bondage in places as varied as Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. Their diverse experiences of exploitation, struggle, perseverance, and liberation lie at the core of the foundation, and entrenchment, of the colonial order in the Americas.   This course introduces students to scholarship on the history of the slave societies of the colonial Americas. It will trace how African and Afro-descendant people's varied experiences of slavery and freedom between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries forged an interconnected and diverse Black Atlantic world.

2026	JUDA 224  Judaism and Christianity: Two Religions or One? 3.0 Credits	The relation between Christianity and Judaism is one of the most misunderstood in the history of thought. Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.

2167	PHIL 291  Judaism and Christianity: Two Religions or One? 3.0 Credits	The relation between Christianity and Judaism is one of the most misunderstood in the history of thought. Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther,  have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.
