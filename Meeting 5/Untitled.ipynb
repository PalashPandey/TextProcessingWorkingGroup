    "\n",
    "A Markov Chain is a stochastic (random) process that models a finite set of states, with fixed conditional probabilities of jumping from a given state to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is, we will have an “agent” that randomly jumps around different states, with a certain probability of going from each state to another one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show what a Markov Chain looks like, we can use a digraph, where each node is a state (with a label or associated data), and the weight of the edge that goes from node a to node b is the probability of jumping from state a to state b.\n"

    "### To understand markov chains, we need to understand Finite State Machines \n",
    "\n",
    " It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A finite state machine can be used as a representation of a Markov chain. Assuming a sequence of independent and identically distributed input signals (for example, symbols from a binary alphabet chosen by coin tosses), if the machine is in state y at time n, then the probability that it moves to state x at time n + 1 depends only on the current state.\n"
