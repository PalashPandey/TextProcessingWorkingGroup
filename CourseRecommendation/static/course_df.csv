1488|CJS 280  Communities and Crime 3.0 Credits|This course introduces students to the ecological study of crime. Crime varies in time, space, and populations as it reflects neighborhood structures and the routine social interactions that occur in daily life.  Concentrations of crime can be found among locations, with antisocial activities like assaults and theft occurring at higher rates because of the demographic make-up of people (e.g., adolescents) or conflicts (e.g., competing gangs), for reasons examined by ecological criminology.  We examine variations in socio-demographic structures (age, education ratios, and the concentration of poverty) and the physical environment (housing segregation, density of bars, street lighting) predicts variations between neighborhoods in the level of crime and disorder.|CJS 280|Communities and Crime |3.0|[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]|['CJS 220', 'CJS 200', 'CJS 362', 'CJS 290', 'CJS 330', 'CJS 101', 'CJS 266', 'ENVS 260', 'SOC 406', 'CJS 369']

1494|CJS 302  Advanced Criminological Theorizing 3.0 Credits|This course offers a detailed examination of several major theories of crime. Whereas CJS200/CJ204-Criminology represents a survey of many criminological theories, this advanced course focuses on three major perspectives in criminology: Life-course, genetics/bio-social, social disorganization (and specifically, subculture of violence) theories. The course also helps students understand how different criminological theories might integrate with each other to offer broad perspectives the causes of crime.|CJS 302|Advanced Criminological Theorizing |3.0|[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]|['CJS 330', 'CJS 200', 'CJS 220', 'CJS 290', 'CJS T380', 'SOC 356', 'ORGB 320', 'EDUC 201', 'PSY 290', 'CJS 280']
1495|CJS 320  Comparative Justice Systems 3.0 Credits|This course offers students a transnational perspective on crime and justice institutions. As the world increasingly globalizes, it becomes increasingly important to understand how countries outside the United States undertake the processes of detecting crime, labeling people “criminal,” and adjudicating criminal offenders.

2026|JUDA 224  Judaism and Christianity: Two Religions or One? 3.0 Credits|The relation between Christianity and Judaism is one of the most misunderstood in the history of thought. Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge?

2167|PHIL 291  Judaism and Christianity: Two Religions or One? 3.0 Credits|The relation between Christianity and Judaism is one of the most misunderstood in the history of thought. Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther,  have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge?
